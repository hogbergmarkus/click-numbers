## Website owner and user goals

2. The owner wants people to stay on the website.
3. People should come back to play more games.

### Goals of the user

## Website owner and user stories

### Website owner story

For the owner it is important that people want to stay on the website, as well

as that the users come back to play more games.

Using a timer or other similar game element, should provide a competitive touch

that will help achieve those goals.

With enough traffic and retention on the website, add revenue would be possible.

### User story

The user is looking for something to pass time, and that something should also

provide a challenge. It has to be fast and easy to pick up and play wherever they are.

If the game lets them compete against themselves they are sure to come back for more.

## Design

### Wireframes

Here you will find the link to my wireframes from the design phase:

[Wireframes](https://github.com/hogbergmarkus/click-numbers/tree/main/documentation/wireframes)

### Fonts

1. Playpen Sans was chosen as the main font. I liked it for its playful looks,

    and felt it was well suited to give a joyful style to the pages otherwise
    simple styling.

2. Lato was chosen as a backup, because of its wide compatibility, readability,
    and modern style.

### Colors

I chose to keep the colors muted an simple, because I didnt want to distract the

player, while they try to find the correct numbers.

Also, the gray background with white text reminds me of sitting in my IDE,
which I quite enjoy.
